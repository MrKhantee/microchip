Throttle - Memory Processor Monitor
=============================================================================

Throttle is an extremely small app that shows the processor usage as an icon in the status bar.

It does one thing and aims to do it well without any excessive bloat. Throttle has a minimal memory footprint and is primarily active while the screen is on.
